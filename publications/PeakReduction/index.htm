                  <h2>Abstract</h2>
                  A technique is described for a better than 5 dB reduction in 
                  the Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of an OFDM signal. The 
                  optimal amplitude and phase of additional peak reduction carriers 
                  (PRC) is obtained using a code-book, which is obtained using 
                  a search of all possible signal combinations. 
                  <h2> 1 Introduction</h2>
                  Wireless digital communications is rapidly expanding, resulting 
                  in a demand for wireless systems that are reliable and have 
                  a high spectral efficiency. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing 
                  (OFDM) has a high tolerance to multipath signals and is spectrally 
                  efficient making it a good candidate for future wireless communication 
                  systems. 
                  <p>One disadvantage of OFDM is that the peak of the signal can 
                    be up to N times the average power (where N is the number 
                    of carriers). These large peaks increase the amount of intermodulation 
                    distortion resulting in an increase in the error rate. The 
                    average signal power must be kept low in order to prevent 
                    the transmitter amplifier limiting. Minimising the PAPR allows 
                    a higher average power to be transmitted for a fixed peak 
                    power, improving the overall signal to noise ratio at the 
                    receiver. It is therefore important to minimise the PAPR. 
                  <p>A large amount of research has been done on broadcast OFDM 
                    systems, however most wireless communication systems must 
                    support multiple users. One application that a multi-user 
                    OFDM system would be suitable for is fixed wireless telephony 
                    applications. In such a system each user is allocated a small 
                    percentage of the system carriers, typically 4-16 depending 
                    on the symbol rate used. This paper presents a method for 
                    reducing the PAPR of a OFDM signal that contains data. It 
                    is optimised for a low number of carriers making it a suitable 
                    technique for multi-user OFDM. 
                  <h2> 2 Background</h2>
                  The PAPR of an OFDM signal can be reduced in several ways. Selective 
                  mapping [1, 2] involves generating a large set of data vectors 
                  all representing the same information. The data vector with 
                  the lowest resulting PAPR is selected. Information about which 
                  particular data vector was used is sent as additional carriers. 
                  However there may be potential problems with decoding the signal 
                  in the presence of noise with selective mapping. Errors in the 
                  reverse mapping would result in the data of whole symbols being 
                  lost. 
                  <p>Another technique similar to selective mapping is using Golay 
                    sequences [6]. Information is transmitted by mapping each 
                    data word with a Golay sequence. Using Golay sequences result 
                    in a low PAPR, typically 3-6 dB, however the coding rate is 
                    poor, typically half, resulting in a large bandwidth increase. 
                    Cyclic coding [3] involves adding extra carriers in which 
                    the phase of every fourth carrier is calculated based on an 
                    algorithm using the phase of the previous three information 
                    carriers. This method is similar to the presented technique 
                    except that it gives sub optimal results. 
                  <h2> 3 Peak Reduction Carriers</h2>
                  This paper presents a technique that combines selective mapping 
                  and cyclic coding. A reduction in the PAPR is achieved by adding 
                  extra carriers referred to as Peak Reduction Carriers (PRC). 
                  The phase and amplitude of the PRCs is varied to minimise the 
                  overall PAPR. The original information carriers are unaffected 
                  and can be decoded normally. The receiver can disregard the 
                  PRCs, or they can be used for error detection. The frequency 
                  of PRCs, or relative positioning of the PRCs can be varied with 
                  respect to the information carriers depending on the application. 
                  The results presented were found using a computationally intensive 
                  exhaustive search to find the optimal setting for the PRCs. 
                  However it is assumed that further work will allow a more efficient 
                  algorithm to be found. 
                  <p>An optimal setting for the PRCs corresponds to the combination 
                    of phase and amplitude that achieves the lowest PAPR of the 
                    overall OFDM symbol (information carriers and PRCs). In this 
                    paper the phase and amplitude of the PRCs was set in a coarse 
                    quantised manner to minimise the number of combinations needed 
                    to be searched. The phase of the PRCs was set to 0&deg; or 
                    180&deg; and the carriers were turned on or off. There are 
                    therefore 3<sup>M</sup> combinations for the PRCs for each 
                    information code word (where M is the number of PRCs). This 
                    level of quantisation was found to be appropriate for BPSK 
                    information carriers. Finer quantisation may produce improved 
                    results for higher modulation schemes. 
                  <p>An exhaustive search of all combinations of allowable phase 
                    and amplitude gives optimal PRCs, but is computationally intensive. 
                    This method can be used for small numbers of carriers where 
                    the optimal PRC coding can be stored in a look up table or 
                    code-book. This is impractical for more than 16 information 
                    carriers or for more than 10 PRCs as the number of combinations 
                    becomes too large to store and calculate. However for some 
                    multi-user OFDM applications 16 or less carriers per user 
                    is sufficient. 
                  <p>The results shown were calculated based on all combinations 
                    of information code words, thus will give a good indication 
                    of the practical PAPR improvement. 
                  <p>For each experiment the inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) 
                    of the carrier configuration was used to give a complex base 
                    band signal. Let the complex base band signal be defined as 
                    in eqn. 1.&nbsp; <br>

                  For the simulations carried out, the base band carriers were 
                  centred on DC and the size of the IFFT was made at least 8 times 
                  greater than the number of carriers, oversampling the time domain 
                  signal. This ensures that peaks in the signal were accurately 
                  represented to get an accurate PAPR [4, 5].

                  <p>Figure 1 shows the worst case PAPR and the 90% point in the 
                    cumulative distribution of PAPR as the number of PRCs is increased. 
                    The maximum PAPR for the 8 information carriers is reduced 
                    by >5.5dB for the addition of 10 PRCs. Selecting the optimal 
                    amplitude and phase of the PRC improves the performance significantly 
                    as compared with only setting the phase as used in cyclic 
                    coding [3]. For this reason phase and amplitude modulation 
                    of the PRCs was used in all later experiments due to the improved 
                    performance. 
                  <p>Figure 2 shows the effect of adding PRCs to the PAPR as the 
                    number of information carriers is varied. The improvement 
                    in PAPR remains relatively constant as the number of information 
                    carriers is increased. This shows that this technique gives 
                    consistent performance gains as the number of information 
                    carriers is varied. 
                  <p>Adding PRCs reduces the PAPR at the expense of additional 
                    transmission power. Figure 3 shows the net improvement in 
                    PAPR due to the addition of PRCs. The PAPR reduction was calculated 
                    as the difference between the PAPR results for zero PRCs and 
                    the PAPR results with the addition of PRCs. The loss in signal 
                    power due to the PRCs was then subtracted from the PAPR reduction 
                    in order to give the net PAPR improvement. If the data signal 
                    power lost due to the transmission of the PRCs was more than 
                    the PAPR gain then there would be little point in adding the 
                    PRCs. It can be seen that for 10 BPSK carriers there is little 
                    improvement in adding more than 2 PRCs. In fact adding more 
                    than 5 PRCs results in a worsening of the average (50%) PAPR. 
                    This is due to the power cost of the PRCs. 
                  <h2> 4 Effect of PRC Position</h2>
                  Previous results are shown for grouped PRCs that were positioned 
                  immediately after the data carriers as shown in Figure 4a. Two 
                  different positioning tests were performed. One test kept the 
                  PRCs grouped together as in Figure 4a, however they were moved 
                  with respect to the data carriers as in Figure 4b.The second 
                  test positioned the PRCs in a spread out manner. The best spread 
                  pattern was established using a randomised search.

                  Adding PRCs use a significant amount of additional bandwidth. 
                  It is therefore important to minimise the number used, or to 
                  position the PRCs so that the bandwidth can be reused. For example, 
                  in a multi-user OFDM system where each user transmits a block 
                  of carriers, the PRCs can be overlapped, i.e. they are transmitted 
                  at the same frequency, effectively halving the bandwidth. 
                  <h2> 4.1 Grouped PRCs</h2>
                  <p>In this scheme the PRCs were maintained as a group of carriers. 
                    They were repositioned by sliding them with respect to the 
                    data carriers. Figure 5 and 6 show the effect of the position 
                    on effectiveness of the PRCs. Figure 5 shows for a small number 
                    of PRCs the position of the PRCs within the data carriers 
                    has little effect on the performance. However with 4 or more 
                    PRCs the position has a significant effect on the performance 
                    of the PRCs.Placing the PRCs within the data carriers with 
                    an off centre of 3 carriers gives the best results. This gives 
                    a further reduction of 1dB as compared with edge grouped PRCs. 
                    Not having edge grouped PRCs would prevent overlapping of 
                    the PRCs for a multi-user OFDM, thus doubling the bandwidth 
                    used by the PRCs. </p>

                  <h2> 4.2 Spread PRCs</h2>
                  The position of the 4 grouped PRCs had a significant effect 
                  on the PRC performance, thus it seemed likely that spreading 
                  the PRCs out might lead to further improvements. The exact relationship 
                  between the position of the PRCs and the PAPR distribution is 
                  currently unknown and so a random search was used for optimisation. 
                  The PRCs and data carriers were positioned randomly to form 
                  a block of carriers with no gaps as shown in figure 4d. For 
                  each position combination the PAPR distribution was found and 
                  the combination which resulted in the lowest maximum PAPR was 
                  selected as the optimised PRCs position. 
                  <p align="left">The PAPR distribution was found by testing all 
                    combinations of the data code words. For each data code word 
                    combination the optimum PRCs were found as described in section 
                    3. The PAPR distribution verses the number of PRCs is shown 
                    in figure 7. This result is for 10 data carriers and shows 
                    that spreading the PRCs can result in large reductions in 
                    the PAPR of the OFDM symbol. A reduction of > 6dB is possible.

                  <p>Figure 8 shows the overall net improvement in the PAPR using 
                    position optimised PRC. This can be directly compared to figure 
                    3 which shows the results for edge grouped PRCs. The maximum 
                    net gain for position optimised PRCs is nearly double that 
                    of the edge grouped PRCs. Figure 8 shows that the net PAPR 
                    gain increases rapidly up to 4 PRCs, after which the gain 
                    is minimal. Thus the optimal number of PRCs would be 4 for 
                    10 data carriers. Other tests also show that the number of 
                    PRCs needs to be approximately 40% of the number of data carriers 
                    in order to get significant improvements in the PAPR. 
                  <p>Overlapping of the spread PRCs in a multi-user OFDM system 
                    is more difficult as most of the PRCs will be bounded with 
                    data carriers. Thus simple overlapping may not be possible. 
                    This would be the case if the data and PRC are grouped. However 
                    if the carriers for each user are spread out it might be possible 
                    have spread out PRCs that overlap between the users, but still 
                    provide a large reduction in the PAPR. 
                  <p>The addition of 4 PRCs with 10 data carriers results is a 
                    large net gain of 4.5 dB, allowing more power to be transmitted. 
                    For a transmission with no PRCs at an error rate of 1x10<sup>-3</sup>, 
                    adding the PRCs and maintaining the same peak power the error 
                    rate would be decreased to 1x10<sup>-7</sup> [7]. This is 
                    more efficient than adding error correcting bits at the same 
                    coding rate. For example using Hamming coding at a rate of 
                    4 parity bits for 11 data bits gives a gain of only 1.2 dB 
                    at a bit error rate of 1x10<sup>-4</sup> [7] which is significantly 
                    less than 4.5dB.

                  <h2> 5 Conclusion</h2>
                  Adding peak reduction carriers can significantly improve the 
                  PAPR of an OFDM signal. The PRCs can result in a reduction of 
                  >6dB in the maximum PAPR and a net reduction of >4.5dB when 
                  the additional power for PRCs is taken into account. It was 
                  found that varying the amplitude as well as phase for the PRCs 
                  gave improved performance over just phase variation. It was 
                  also found that spreading the position of the PRCs resulted 
                  in a better performance than grouped PRCs. Adding more PRCs 
                  results in a lower PAPR, however the use of large numbers of 
                  PRCs is limited by the cost of additional transmission power, 
                  bandwidth and complexity limits.
