  generation mobile phone systems are in operation. These phones primarily
  provide voice services, with very limited data applications. Third
  generations systems will be introduced world wide around 2003. These systems
  will provide a data rate ranging from 144 kbps to 2 Mbps depending on the
  distance from the base station and the velocity of the user. The principle
  aim of third generation systems is to provide data services, allowing high
  speed mobile internet terminals, along with video phone communication. Third
  generation systems use an RF carrier modulation scheme called Direct Sequence
  Code Division Multiple Access, which is similar to the current CDMA systems
  in operation, such as IS-95. Third generation systems use a wide bandwidth of
  5 MHz to achieve a high data rate.</font><br>
