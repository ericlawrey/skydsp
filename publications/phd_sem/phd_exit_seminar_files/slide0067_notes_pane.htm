  shows the resulting BER of the communications when using adaptive modulation.
  Most of the errors occur at the boundaries between changes in modulation
  scheme allocation, and when the SNR was dropping. This is due to the delay in
  the allocation updates. Also to note is that the average spectral efficiency
  is 2 bits/Hz/sec and that the BER is very low.</font><br>
