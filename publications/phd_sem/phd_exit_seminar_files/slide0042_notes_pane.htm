  allocation optimises both the subcarriers and bandwidth used by each user. In
  the above plot each user is shown as a different colour. Those users that
  have a weak signal are only allocated a small number of subcarriers. This
  ensures that their energy spectral density is high enough to allow reliable
  communications. The allocation in the above plot was for a coarse allocation
  in time and frequency. This was done to so that each allocation could be
  easily seen.</font><br>
