  results in several detrimental effects on communications. Short term fading
  is caused by the interference (constructive or destructive) that results from
  the combination of multiple received waves. As the receiver or transmitter
  are moved in space the relative phase between the different multipath
  components change, causing the interference to also change, resulting in
  fades in the received signal power. At certain locations the signal can
  suffer almost compete cancellation of the signal, resulting in a deep null in
  the signal power. These nulls can be as much as 30 dB deep. Nulls occur
  approximately at intervals of the RF wavelength (30 cm for 1 GHz
  transmission).</font><br>
