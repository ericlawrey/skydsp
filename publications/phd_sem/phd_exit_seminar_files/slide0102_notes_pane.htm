  <td align=left colspan=1><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>As each
  multipath signal arrives at the receiver it causes constructive or
  destructive interference depending on the time delay and the strength of the
  reflection. As the amplitude and phase of an OFDM subcarrier is changed from
  one symbol to the next, it takes time for all of the reflections to update to
  the new symbol state. As the new symbol state changes arrives for each
  delayed reflection it results in a transient change in the amplitude and
  phase seen by the receiver. After a sufficiently long time (longer than the
  delay spread of the channel) a steady state amplitude and phase is achieved.
  The corresponds to the combined vector sum of the direct signal and all the
  multipath signals. If the FFT of the receiver is taken during this steady
  state period of the symbol then the effects of ISI are eliminated. The
  function of the guard period is to extend the length of the each transmitted
  OFDM symbol so that the receiver can throw away the signals during the
  transient period, but still have a sufficient number of samples to decode the
  signal.</font><br>
