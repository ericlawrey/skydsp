  in just about every terrestrial radio link, especially if the receiver is at
  a location that is non-line of sight of the transmitter. Multipath is caused
  by the transmitted signal arriving at the receiver via multiple paths. The
  transmitted signal reflects off objects in the environment. These signals
  arrive at the receiver some time after the initial direct signal as they
  travel a longer distance and so have a longer propagation time. This results
  in a spread of the signal in time, which is referred to as delay spread.</font><br>
