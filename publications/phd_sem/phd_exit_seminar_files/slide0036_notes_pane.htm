  effectiveness of using APRs to reduce interference was tested. This was
  performed using the shadow simulator developed in Matlab. Two building were
  set up, both identical. The top building is where the test WLAN system is to
  operate and the bottom building is where the interferer passes through. The
  diagrams at the bottom of the slide show the calculated signal power in dBm
  as the interferer moves.</font><br>
