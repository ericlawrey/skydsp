  shows the results of the measurements. It shows the accumulated probability
  distribution for the pathloss, showing the probability of the pathloss being
  worse than a given pathloss. For example, for the single transmitter
  measurement there was a probability of 0.2 (20%) of the pathloss being
  greater than 90 dB. However when two transmitters was used, the probability
  dropped to 0.025 (2.5%). The net improvement was 7 dB.</font><br>
