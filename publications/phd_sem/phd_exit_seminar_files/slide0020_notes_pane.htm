  was performed to investigate the how frequency selective fading varies with
  small changes in space. The results of this investigation was used to measure
  the performance of the proposed adaptive OFDM system, which allocates the
  subcarrier modulation scheme based on the signal to noise ratio of each
  subcarrier.</font><br>

  <td align=left colspan=1><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>The experiment
  was performed by measuring the power frequency response of an indoor radio
  channel using a sweeping signal generator and a spectrum analyser. The
  receiver antenna was then moved along a 2.4 m guide track in steps of 1 cm.
  The frequency response of the channel was measured for each movement of the
  antenna.</font><br>
