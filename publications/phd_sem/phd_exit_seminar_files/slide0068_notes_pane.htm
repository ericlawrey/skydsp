  <td align=left colspan=1><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>One of the
  Frequency Selective Fading measurements was used to simulate the performance
  of an adaptive modulation system. The above plot shows the resulting SNR as a
  function frequency and distance moved for a fixed transmission power of –8
  dBm. The average SNR is about 17 dB, however there are many nulls in the
  spectrum where the SNR is below 5 dB. This SNR was chosen because the
  spectral efficiency of the resulting adaptive modulation was 2 bits/Hz/sec
  allowing it to be directly compared with the performance of QPSK.</font><br>
