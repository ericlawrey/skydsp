  LAN systems use a single transmission location to provide coverage over the
  area of a building or coverage of a small group of buildings. Providing this
  coverage from a single transmission location is difficult due to shadowing
  caused by walls, and objects in the building.</font><br>

  Repeaters is a simple method for providing reduced pathloss in areas that
  suffer from significant shadowing. The signal from the base station is
  transmitted (and received) from multiple locations. Each transmitter appears
  as multipath to the mobile receiver, however provided the delay spread is
  shorter than the guard period of the OFDM signal then the multipath signals
  increase the received signal power, while not resulting in inter-symbol
  interference.</font><br>
