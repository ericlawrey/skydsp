  <td align=left colspan=1><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>OFDM signals can
  be though of as a set of many subcarriers transmitting in parallel at a low
  symbol rate. Consequently the first step in the OFDM generator is to allocate
  serial input data to each of the subcarriers in an OFDM symbol.<span
  style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After the data has been converted from
  serial to parallel it is then modulated. Typical subcarrier modulation
  schemes include BPSK, QPSK, 16QAM. In fact each subcarrier in an OFDM signal
  can be modulated with a different scheme. After subcarrier modulation we have
  a frequency domain representation of the signal that we want. This signal is
  converted from the frequency domain to the time domain using an Inverse Fast
  Fourier Transform (IFFT). A guard period is added between each of the
  symbols, and additional frame synchronisation symbols are added before
  transmission.</font><br>

  <td align=left colspan=1><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>An OFDM receiver
  logically does the reverse operations to the transmitter. It converts the
  incoming time domain waveform to the frequency domain using a Fast Fourier
  Transform (FFT), then it demodulates each subcarrier, based on the received
  amplitude and phase and the modulation scheme used. The data is then
  converted from parallel to serial. Other functions that the receiver must
  perform are time and frequency synchronisation and channel equalisation.</font><br>
