  of a single antenna base station was simulated. The results here show the
  signal to interference ratio of the WLAN building and surrounding areas. The
  scale is in dB. The two numbers on the plots show the performance as the
  interferer moves, which is shown as a white cross. The top number shows the
  average spectral efficiency that could be achieved if the system were using
  adaptive modulation, while the lower number shows the percentage area of the
  building which has a signal to interference ratio below 10 dB. This
  represents the quality of service, where the lower the number the better.</font><br>
