  <td align=left colspan=1><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>The results of
  the measurements show the wide bandwidth fading pattern of the channel. From
  this we can see nulls in the spectrum (shown in dark red) and the peaks in
  the response (in yellow white). The dotted line shows the mean path loss.</font><br>

  <td colspan=1></td>
  <td align=left colspan=1><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>This result
  shows the response for a Line Of Sight (LOS) transmission. As a result of
  this the direct signal tends to dominate and consequently the delay spread of
  the channel is low. When the delay spread of the channel is low the frequency
  separation between the nulls tends to be large (coherence bandwidth), as we
  can see here. At 95 cm along there are no nulls even over a bandwidth of 70
  MHz.</font><br>
