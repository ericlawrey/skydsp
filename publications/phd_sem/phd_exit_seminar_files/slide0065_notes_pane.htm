  <td align=left colspan=1><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>While DAB and
  DVB are broadcast systems, there have not been many multiuser, two-way
  systems utilising OFDM. Hiperlan/2 and the IEEE802.11a standard are Wireless
  LAN standards which use OFDM to provide the highest data rate WLAN available.
  The standard for Hiperlan/2 was finalised in Jan 2001, with products being
  available mid 2002. It operates in the 5.2 GHz ISM (Industrial Scientific
  Medical) band, which is license free. It provides a variable data rate up to
  a maximum of 54 Mbps in a 20 MHz channel. The actual signal bandwidth is 16
  MHz, with the extra 4 MHz used to allow for roll off of the signal to prevent
  inter-channel interference. The system uses 48 data carriers, plus 4 pilot
  carriers. It also allows for some bit rate adaptation based on the channel
  conditions, allowing several subcarrier modulation schemes to be used.</font><br>
