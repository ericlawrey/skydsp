  were performed in the Electrical and Computer Engineering building at James
  Cook University. The construction of this building is fairly typical of a
  multilevel office building. Measurements were taken at ten locations (some
  were taken at the same location but at different heights) around the
  building. These locations were chosen to get a typical distribution of the
  channel response as would be seen by 10 mobile users. These measurement sets
  were used to model a multiuser OFDM system.</font><br>
