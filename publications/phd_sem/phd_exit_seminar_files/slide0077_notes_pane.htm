  simulation was used to estimate the further improvements that could be made
  using more transmitters. Increasing the number of APRs results in a reduced
  pathloss because it reduces the average distance to a transmitter. When a
  single transmitter is used in free space the signal power reduces in
  proportion with the distance squared. If we took the logical extension of
  increasing the number of APR, then we would end up with a plane of
  transmission, with the power spread evenly over the inner surface of the
  building’s ceiling. When close to this plane (as is the case when inside the
  building) the power decreases in proportion to the distance, as a result the
  pathloss will be half (in dB) to free space loss.</font><br>
