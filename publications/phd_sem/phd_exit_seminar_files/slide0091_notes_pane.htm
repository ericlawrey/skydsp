  <td align=left colspan=1><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>OFDM has many
  advantages over single carrier modulation schemes. These include a strong
  multipath tolerance, flexible channel optimisation, and a high spectral
  efficiency. The flexibility of OFDM is a result of the subcarrier
  independence in modulation scheme allocation.</font><br>

  <td align=left colspan=1><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Due to the
  multi-carrier nature of OFDM it is more sensitive to frequency tracking
  errors, Doppler shift (frequency offset due to movement of the transmitter or
  receiver), Doppler spread (frequency modulation due to movement of the
  transmitter or receiver in a multipath channel), and phase noise. OFDM
  requires the use of linear amplification to prevent spectral spreading, which
  is caused by intermodulation distortion creating unwanted out of band
  spectral components. The required linearity of the amplification depends on
  the subcarrier modulation scheme. There is a direct trade off between the
  linearity required and the spectral efficiency.</font><br>

  <td align=left colspan=1><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Another
  disadvantage of OFDM is that the envelope of the time waveform can vary over
  a large range. This results in a large peak to average power ratio.</font><br>
