  <td align=left colspan=1><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>OFDM subcarriers
  have a sinc (sin(x)/x) frequency response resulting in overlap in the
  frequency domain. This overlap does however not cause any interference due to
  the orthogonality of the subcarriers. The above plot shows a 5 carrier OFDM
  signal. The thick black line shows the combined response, while the circles
  show the signal seen by the receiver. The OFDM receiver uses a time and
  frequency synchronised FFT to convert the OFDM time waveform back into the
  frequency domain. In this process the FFT picks up discrete frequency
  samples, corresponding to just the peaks of the carriers. At these
  frequencies, all other carriers pass through zero amplitude eliminating any
  interference between the subcarriers.</font><br>
