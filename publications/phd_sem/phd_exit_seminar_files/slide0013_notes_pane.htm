  <td align=left colspan=1><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Digital data is
  transferred by each subcarrier sending an IQ vector in each data symbol.
  These correspond the red crosses in the above figures and is achieved by
  setting the amplitude and phase of the subcarrier. The amplitude corresponds
  to the distance from the origin while the phase corresponds to the angle of
  the vector. Each IQ vector is mapped to a group of transmitted bits (shown in
  white next to the crosses in 16 PSK). This mapping is known by both the
  transmitter and receiver.</font><br>
