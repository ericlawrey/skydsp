                  <h1>Abstract</h1>
                  <p class="bodytext">This paper presents adaptive frequency hopping 
                    as a new user allocation scheme for multiuser OFDM. Users 
                    are allocated carriers that have the highest SNR of available 
                    system carriers. This process is updated regularly to track 
                    channel fading. Adaptive frequency hopping greatly reduces 
                    frequency selective fading, improves interference rejection, 
                    and consequently improves the received SNR. Additionally Doppler 
                    spread is minimised due to the avoidance of nulls in the spectrum. 
                    These effects improve the system capacity and user access 
                    reliability. Improvements in system capacity out weigh the 
                    overhead required for implementation of adaptive frequency 
                    hopping for applications that have a user data rate of greater 
                    than 20 kbps at 100 km/hr and 5 kbps for fixed transmissions.</p>
                  <h1>1 Introduction</h1>
                  <p class="bodytext">Multiuser OFDM is a promising new modulation 
                    technique for wireless communications [1]. It includes many 
                    of the advantages of broadcast OFDM that is used for Digital 
                    Audio Broadcasting (DAB) [2] and for Digital Video Broadcasting 
                    (DVB) in Europe and Australia. OFDM was selected for these 
                    systems primarily because of its high spectral efficiency 
                    and multipath tolerance.</p>
                  <p class="bodytext">In a multiuser OFDM system, data is transmitted 
                    as a set of parallel low bandwidth (1 kHz - 50 kHz) carriers. 
                    The frequency spacing between these carriers is chosen to 
                    be the reciprocal of the useful symbol period. The resulting 
                    carriers are orthogonal to each other at the receiver provided 
                    correct time windowing is used. Transmitted carriers are independent 
                    of each other even though their spectra overlap. OFDM signals 
                    can be easily generated and received using a Fast Fourier 
                    Transform (FFT). For a multiuser OFDM system each user is 
                    allocated a fraction of the system carriers. 
                  <p class="bodytext">Wahlqvist [3] presented one implementation 
                    of a multiuser OFDM system. A user allocation scheme using 
                    random frequency hopping scheme was presented. This paper 
                    presents a new user carrier allocation scheme where each user 
                    is allocated carriers that have the highest Signal to Noise 
                    Ratio (SNR). Adaptive frequency hopping involves characterising 
                    the radio channels of each link, and allocating carriers appropriately.</p>
                  <h1>2 User allocation</h1>
                  <p class="bodytext">There are several methods for allocating 
                    carriers to users in a multiuser OFDM system. The main four 
                    schemes are to use a group of carriers with a fixed frequency, 
                    randomly hopped group of carriers, spread out carriers in 
                    a comb pattern and adaptive frequency hopping.</p>
                  <p class="bodytext">Due to the overlapping nature of OFDM any 
                    loss of orthogonality can result in high levels of inter-carrier 
                    interference. Frequency and time synchronisation errors result 
                    in loss of orthogonality between carriers. A frequency offset 
                    error of 1-2% of the carrier spacing results a carrier power 
                    to interference ratio of 20dB[4]. In the forward link all 
                    user carriers are transmitted from the base station, and thus 
                    all carriers can be transmitted with perfect frequency and 
                    time synchronisation with respect to each other.However in 
                    the reverse link, carriers from each user are transmitted 
                    from different sources, leading to possible inter-user interference. 
                    Distortion products can result in inter-user interference, 
                    particularly if the received power from one user is significantly 
                    larger than neighbouring user carriers.</p>
                  <h2>2.1 Fixed frequency grouped carriers</h2>
                  <p class="bodytext">The simplest user carrier allocation scheme 
                    is to assign each user a group of fixed frequency carriers. 
                    Grouping the carriers minimises inter-user interference due 
                    to distortion, power level variation and frequency errors. 
                    However, having a fixed group of carriers makes the transmission 
                    susceptible to fading, as the whole group of carriers can 
                    be lost in a null in the spectrum. Time interleaving with 
                    forward error correction can improve fading performance of 
                    a moving station. However for stationary applications, static 
                    nulls can greatly degrade performance.</p>
                  <h2>2.2 Grouped carriers with random frequency hopping</h2>
                  <p class="bodytext">The problem of static fading can be partly 
                    overcome by randomly frequency hopping the carriers. In the 
                    user allocation scheme described by [2], groups of carriers 
                    are transmitted in short time blocks. These blocks are randomly 
                    frequency hopped to ensure that the time period spent in a 
                    null would is relatively short, approximately 11 symbols. 
                    To recover data lost during a null, time interleaving and 
                    forward error correction is used. These come at the cost of 
                    reduced system data capacity and increased delay.</p>
                  <h2>2.3 Comb Spread Carriers</h2>
                  <p class="bodytext">Static nulls can occur for fixed wireless 
                    applications causing problems if the transmission uses a single 
                    group of carriers with a fixed frequency. Instead carriers 
                    can be allocated in a fixed comb pattern, spreading them over 
                    the entire system bandwidth. This improves the frequency diversity, 
                    preventing all the carriers used by a user being lost in a 
                    single null in the spectrum. </p>
                  <p class="bodytext">Using a comb pattern reduces the probability 
                    that all carriers will be lost in a null, however it increases 
                    the chance that some of the carriers will be in a null due 
                    to the increased frequency span of the carrier comb pattern. 
                    It is therefore essential that forward error correction be 
                    used in order to recover data lost in null carriers. </p>
                  <p class="bodytext">Additionally this allocation scheme may 
                    be susceptible to inter-user interference due to the overlapping 
                    nature of OFDM carriers. Transmitting as a comb pattern requires 
                    user carriers to be interleaved with one another, resulting 
                    in a large amount of overlapping energy between the users. 
                    Any slight loss of orthogonality due to frequency or timing 
                    errors can result in significant inter-user interference. 
                    By comparison grouping the user carriers reduces the energy 
                    overlap between users, thus reducing inter-user interference. 
                    Despite these problems this type of user allocation is useful 
                    in applications that can not use adaptive hopping or random 
                    hopping, due to the added complexity.</p>
                  <h2>2.4 Adaptive Frequency Hopping</h2>
                  <p class="bodytext">A new adaptive frequency hopping technique 
                    is proposed for multiuser OFDM such that blocks of carriers 
                    are hopped based on the current channel conditions. After 
                    the radio channel has been characterised each user is allocated 
                    carriers which have the highest SNR ratio for that user. Since 
                    each user will be in a different location the fading pattern 
                    will be different for each remote station. The strongest carriers 
                    for one user are likely to be different from other users. 
                    Thus most users can be allocated carriers with a high SNR, 
                    allowing the entire system bandwidth to be used without any 
                    nulls. </p>
                  <p class="bodytext">All users must be frequency and time synchronised 
                    to each other in order to use this technique. This technique 
                    is suited to low velocity applications that suffer from frequency 
                    selective fading, and those that have a moderate user data 
                    rate (>50kbps).</p>
                  <p class="bodytext">Two implementations of AFH are presented, 
                    single group AFH and multi-group AFH. With single group AFH 
                    all user carriers are allocated as a single group of consecutive 
                    carriers. With multi-group AFH carriers are allocated in independent 
                    small blocks (2-10) of carriers.</p>
                  <h1>3 Advantages of Adaptive Frequency Hopping</h1>
                  <h2>3.1 Frequency Selective Fading Minimisation</h2>
                  <p class="bodytext">Adaptive frequency hopping achieves large 
                    performance gains by avoiding nulls in the channel frequency 
                    response caused by frequency selective fading. Provided that 
                    the system bandwidth is significantly greater than the coherence 
                    bandwidth of the channel, there is a high probability that 
                    there will be at least one peak in the frequency response 
                    of the channel available to the user. The larger the system 
                    bandwidth the more chance there is of finding a group of carriers 
                    with a high SNR.<br>

                  <p class="bodytext">Figures 1 and 2 show results for a single 
                    user adaptive frequency hopping system. The radio channel 
                    model used for this experiment was measured for a link between 
                    two rooms in the Electrical and Computer Engineering building 
                    at JCU. The transmitter and receiver were spaced 24 m apart. 
                    This radio link is short resulting in a large coherence bandwidth. 
                    As a result a large system bandwidth was used. These measurements 
                    were obtained using a sweeping tone transmitter and a spectrum 
                    analyser as the receiver. The receiver was moved along a guide 
                    tack after each frequency response measurement was made. </p>
                  <p class="bodytext">Figure 1 shows simulated adaptive frequency 
                    hopping for the measured radio channel. For this experiment 
                    the bandwidth allocated to the user was 5 % of the system 
                    bandwidth and 50 % of the channel coherence bandwidth. The 
                    frequency allocations used for AFH were updated every 2cm. 
                    It was assumed that the time required for updating the frequency 
                    re-allocations was negligible. This is a reasonable assumption 
                    for systems where the AFH overhead is low. The frequency groups 
                    used are shown as an outline. </p>

                    power for the worst user carrier at each point in space is 
                    shown. The adaptive hopping receiver suffers much less fading 
                    and has a much greater average power level than when no hopping 
                    is used. A comb user allocation pattern results in a high 
                    probability of at least one of the carriers being in a null, 
                    thus giving a poor performance.</p>
                  <h3>Effect of User Bandwidth&nbsp;</h3>
                  <p class="bodytext">Increasing the user bandwidth increases 
                    the chance that some of the carriers being used will be in 
                    a null. Figure 3 shows the effect of increasing the user bandwidth 
                    while having a fixed system bandwidth. The results were obtained 
                    using the measured data shown in figure 1. At a low user bandwidth 
                    both single and multi group AFH perform the same. This is 
                    because the user bandwidth is much lower than the coherence 
                    bandwidth of the radio channel. As the user bandwidth increases 
                    the effectiveness of single group AFH falls off significantly, 
                    due to the user carriers spaning a bandwidth approaching or 
                    greater than the coherence bandwidth of the channel. Since 
                    the carriers are allocated as a single group, carriers at 
                    the edges of the group will tend to be in a null. Multi-group 
                    AFH doesn’t suffer the same problems as user bandwidth is 
                    increased.</p>

                  <p class="bodytext">Multi-group AFH performs much better than

                  <h3>Effect of System Bandwidth&nbsp;</h3>
                  <p class="bodytext">The effect of changing the system bandwidth 
                    is shown in figure 4. This plot shows the average (over distance) 
                    minimum carrier power for a low bandwidth user as the system 
                    bandwidth is increased. Both single and multi group AFH perform 
                    similarly as the user bandwidth is small. As the system bandwidth 
                    is increased it improves the chance of finding stronger carriers, 
                    thus the performance of AFH improves with an increase in the 
                    system bandwidth. The system bandwidth has no effect of a 
                    fixed group of carriers, as the system carriers are not used 
                    as a resource. When using a comb pattern increasing the system 
                    bandwidth spreads the carriers over a wider number of nulls 
                    in the spectrum. This increases the chance of having at least 
                    one carrier in a deep fade. However the average power for 
                    a comb pattern would remain constant as the system bandwidth 
                    is increased.</p>
                  <h3>Effect of AFH update rate&nbsp;</h3>
                  <p class="bodytext">The frequency response of a radio channel 
                    changes with movement of the transmitter or receiver. It is 
                    therefore important that in any AFH system that it tracks 
                    these changes in the channel. The more often the AFH is updated 
                    the better the performance will be. However, the information 
                    overhead required will be approximately proportional to the 
                    update rate thus it is important minimise the update rate 
                    without loosing the effectiveness of the AFH. Figure 5 shows 
                    the effect of changing the hop update rate on performance 
                    of AFH. The update rate has been specified as a distance. 
                    The update rate can be calculated from the velocity of movement.<br>

                    minimum user carrier power verses system bandwidth</p>
                  <p class="bodytext">Figure 5 shows that increasing the distance 
                    between updates of AFH decreases the performance as would 
                    be expected. Using a hop distance of 7 cm results in about 
                    1 dB loss in performance, 12 cm gives about a 2dB loss. Thus 
                    a hop distance of less than one third the RF wavelength would 
                    be sufficient (10 cm at 1GHz). The frequency hopping distance 
                    will be proportional to the wavelength of the RF signal used. 
                    Results shown here are for an RF frequency of 1GHz.</p>
                  <h3>Performance improvement by AFH&nbsp;</h3>
                  <p class="bodytext">The addition of the AFH reduces the fast 
                    fading. This reduction in signal power variation allows the 
                    fading margin used to be decreased when designing an RF link. 
                    This allows the average transmission power to be reduced or 
                    a higher modulation used with the same transmission power. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="bodytext">The results shown in figures 3-5 are distance 
                    averaged minimum user carrier power. This measure smooths 
                    out deep fades. However during deep fades data is nearly always 
                    lost, thus the depth of the fade in not important. Forward 
                    error correction must be used to recover this information. 
                    However using AFH greatly reduces deep fading (as can be seen 
                    in figure 2), reducing the need for forward error correction. 
                    As less forward error correction is required, a higher user 
                    data rate can be used. </p>
                  <p class="bodytext">AFH improves the average received power 
                    by 6-8dB and reduces the worst case carrier fading by 15-25dB. 
                    AFH allows the system capacity to be increased by reducing 
                    the forward error correction required and allowing a higher 
                    modulation to be used. The average power gain of 6-8dB allows 
                    the modulation to be increased by 1 bits/Hz/sec, while the 
                    reduced fading should allow the forward error correction to 
                    be reduced by 50%. This will result in an overall system capacity 
                    gain of 75-300%.</p>
                  <h2>3.2 Doppler Spread Minimisation</h2>
                  <p class="bodytext">An additional advantage of adaptive hopping 
                    is that it reduces Doppler spread. Doppler spread causes frequency 
                    spreading of the transmitted signal resulting in a reduction 
                    in the orthogonality of the carriers for a multiuser OFDM 
                    system. In a multipath channel, delayed reflected signals 
                    will each have a different Doppler shift due to the direction 
                    of the reflection. As the transmitter or receiver moves the 
                    relative strength of the reflected components will change 
                    resulting in a fast fluctuation of the Doppler shift. This 
                    fluctuation is referred to as Doppler spread. It can be calculated 
                    from the rate of change of the phase response of the radio 
                    channel. </p>
                  <p class="bodytext">As a receiver passes through or near a null 
                    in the spectrum, the signal will shift from one dominant multipath 
                    component to another, resulting in a change in the Doppler 
                    shift. The level of Doppler shift can become many times (>10) 
                    greater than the average Doppler shift. In regions where the 
                    signal is strong the Doppler shift is approximately constant 
                    and equal to the average Doppler shift, thus resulting in 
                    minimal Doppler spread. Using adaptive frequency hopping minimises 
                    transmission near nulls and thus also minimises Doppler spread.</p>
                  <h2>3.3 Interference Rejection</h2>
                  <p class="bodytext">Adaptive frequency hopping will provide 
                    strong interference rejection. Carriers that are interfered 
                    with will have a low SNR, and thus will not be used for transmission. 
                    Since the frequency hopping is regularly updated any changes 
                    in frequency of the interferer will be compensated for very 
                    quickly (&lt;10ms). Interference rejection will be limited 
                    by the overlapping nature of the carriers in multiuser OFDM. 
                    An interferer who is one carrier spacing away will only be 
                    attenuated by 13 dB. After ten carrier spacings the attenuation 
                    will only be 28dB.</p>
                  <h1>4 Overhead Requirements for Adaptive frequency hopping</h1>
                  <h2>4.1 Adaptive Frequency Hopping Update Rate</h2>
                  <p class="bodytext">In a multipath environment the frequency 
                    response of the radio channel will change significantly in 
                    half a wavelength as can be seen in figure 1. For a 1 GHz 
                    transmission it is therefore important that the frequency 
                    update rate is faster than every 15 cm moved. The faster the 
                    frequency hopping is updated the better the performance. Updating 
                    faster than 0.1 x wavelength only gives minimal further improvements. 
                    Typically an update distance of 10 cm is sufficient for a 
                    1 GHz transmission. At a velocity of 60 km/Hr this results 
                    in a required update rate of 160 times per sec.</p>
                  <h2>4.2 Information Overhead</h2>
                  <h3>Full Duplex System&nbsp;</h3>
                  <p class="bodytext">Most two-way communication systems use a 
                    full duplex transmission, in which the forward and reverse 
                    links use a different transmission frequency. In order to 
                    implement an AFH system for this type of system each of the 
                    forward and reverse links must be characterised before frequency 
                    allocations can be made. The number of radio channels that 
                    must be characterised is 2N, where N is the number of users. 
                    In a multiuser OFDM system each link can be characterised 
                    by transmitting a reference symbol in which the transmitted 
                    data is known. The receiver can then compare the received 
                    signal with the ideal signal allowing the phase and amplitude 
                    noise of each carrier to be measured, and consequently an 
                    estimate of the carrier SNR. The number of reference symbols 
                    that must be transmitted is N+1, i.e. one from the base station 
                    in the forward link and one from each user. Transmitting a 
                    comb pattern of pilot carriers can reduce the number of reference 
                    symbols required. Multiple users can transmit interleaved 
                    comb pilot carriers, allowing the reverse link of up to 20 
                    users to be characterised per reference symbol. This reduces 
                    the number of reference symbols to N/M+1 where M is the number 
                    of carriers between pilot carriers in the comb pattern.</p>

                    the user data rate is low and the velocity is high as can 
                    be seen by the large overhead required for the mobile phone 
                    application. This level of overhead outweighs the benefits 
                    obtained by using AFH. However in high data rate applications 
                    the overhead can be very low.</p>
                  <h3>Half Duplex System&nbsp;</h3>
                  <p class="bodytext">For systems that have a lower user data 
                    rate the overhead can be reduced by using a time division 
                    half-duplex system. In such a system both the forward and 
                    reverse links use the same frequency, and two way communication 
                    is achieved by time interleaving the forward and reverse channel 
                    transmissions. A single reference symbol transmitted by the 
                    base station is received by all remote stations, allowing 
                    characterisation of all forward links. Due to the reciprocal 
                    nature of radio channels the transfer function of the reverse 
                    link will be the same as the forward link. The number of reference 
                    symbols needed is reduced from N/M+1 to only 1. Although the 
                    number of reference symbols need is reduced to one the number 
                    of frequency re-allocations will still be proportional to 
                    the number of users. Using a half duplex system reduces the 
                    overhead by 2-3 times.</p>
                  <h1>5 Multiple User Adaptive Frequency Hopping</h1>
                  <p class="bodytext">When there are multiple users, each will 
                    have a different frequency selective fading pattern. As each 
                    user is allocated carriers, the number available to other 
                    users will be diminished. This will start to prevent users 
                    from being allocated the strongest carriers. If the base station 
                    has complete knowledge of all links then an optimal combination 
                    of carrier allocations could be made. However the information 
                    overhead in obtaining the complete knowledge could outweigh 
                    the performance gains. It is therefore important to establish 
                    the minimum amount of information needed by the base station 
                    in order to make suitable carrier allocations. Further work 
                    is to be done on this area to resolve some of these issues.</p>
                  <h1>6 Conclusion</h1>
                  <p class="bodytext">Adaptive frequency hopping for multiuser 
                    OFDM has been presented and shown to be a powerful technique 
                    for reducing the effects of frequency selective fading. Fading 
                    in a multipath channel can be reduced from typically 25 dB 
                    to less than 7 dB, improving the received power by up to 18 
                    dB. This gain in received power can be used to double the 
                    system capacity and provide an additional 6dB link margin. 
                    For full duplex mobile systems with velocities up to 60 km/hr, 
                    the overhead required to implement adaptive frequency hopping 
                    can be kept low (15-25%), provided the user data rate is moderately 
                    high (>100 kbps). The amount of overhead can be reduced by 
                    2-3 times by using a half-duplex system where the transmission 
                    and reception use the same frequency band. For fixed wireless 
                    systems the overheads for adaptive frequency hopping would 
                    be minimal. This paper has presented a new user allocation 
                    technique for multiuser OFDM that will enhance system performance.</p>
