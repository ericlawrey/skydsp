                  <h2>Abstract</h2>
                  <p> Propagation inside buildings suffer from large shadowing 
                    and high multipath effects. This is a serious problem for 
                    Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) systems. This paper shows 
                    that shadowing and path loss can be minimized by exploiting 
                    the multipath tolerance of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing 
                    (OFDM). This can be achieved by using multiple transmission 
                    antennas spread over the area of a WLAN cell. These antennas 
                    act as repeaters, transmitting and receiving the same signal 
                    at the same time. This decreases the average path loss, but 
                    increases the multipath delay spread. Using OFDM allows the 
                    advantage of reduced path loss to be utilized without detrimental 
                    effects of Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) caused by the increased 
                    delay spread. The reduced path loss allows an increased system 
                    capacity, quality of service or a decrease in intercellular 
                    interference in a cellular WLAN.</p>

                  <h2>I. Introduction</h2>
                  <p>Wireless networking is an emerging technology allowing users 
                    the freedom of movement. The aim of wireless local area network 
                    (WLAN) systems is to provide users with a data rate comparable 
                    with wired networks within a limited geographic area. Currently 
                    most WLAN products use direct-sequence spread-spectrum (DSSS) 
                    techniques, based on the IEEE 802.11b Standard, providing 
                    a data rate of 11 Mb/s in the 2.4- GHz industrial-scientific-medical 
                    (ISM) band [1]. The next generation of WLAN systems will be 
                    based on two similar WLAN standards known as: Hiperlan/2 (Europe), 
                    and IEEE802.11a (U.S.) [2]. These support a physical layer 
                    transmission rate of up to 54 Mb/s and use orthogonal frequency-division 
                    multiplexing (OFDM) for the physical layer implementation.</p>
                  <p>OFDM is a multi-carrier modulation scheme, which has a high 
                    immunity to multipath effects and allows a wide range of carrier 
                    modulation schemes to be used. Hiperlan/2 adaptively changes 
                    the forward error correcting coding rate and the carrier modulation 
                    scheme (BPSK, QPSK, 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), 
                    64 QAM) allowing the data rate to be maximized based on the 
                    current radio channel characteristics. Using a higher spectral 
                    efficiency modulation scheme, such as 64 QAM, allows the data 
                    rate to be increased, but requires a higher SNR for a fixed 
                    error rate. Thus, minimizing the path loss, allows the SNR 
                    and corresponding data rate to be maximized.</p>
                  <p>Shadowing can result in numerous regions of the building 
                    having an inadequate coverage, resulting in a poor quality 
                    of service (QOS). This is a significant problem as the QOS 
                    of WLAN systems is very important if they are to replace wired 
                    networking. Shadowing also increases the average path loss 
                    compared with free space, requiring more transmission power, 
                    in order to maintain communications.</p>

                  <p>High-quality coverage of a building can be obtained by using 
                    a cellular system as shown in Fig. 1(a). Each base station 
                    (BS) forms a cell covering a small area of the building. These 
                    cells operate at different frequencies to prevent interference 
                    between them. The path loss is minimized, as the distance 
                    from the mobile station to the closest BS is minimized. Additionally 
                    if the transmission path to the closest BS is blocked, the 
                    mobile can connect to another cell. However, this type of 
                    implementation can be expensive, due to the requirement of 
                    a number of BSs. Additionally, it requires multiple frequency 
                    bands for cellular implementation and hand offs between cells, 
                    increasing the system complexity. This paper presents a simpler 
                    and cheaper method for obtaining reliable coverage, in an 
                    environment that suffers from shadowing. </p>
                  <h2>II. Spatial Diversity by Multiple Repeat Transmissions </h2>
                  <p>A form of spatial diversity can also be achieved by splitting 
                    the signal from a single central BS and transmitting the same 
                    signal from multiple locations around the building to be covered. 
                    This is shown in Fig. 1(b). Shadowing is reduced because there 
                    are multiple opportunities to receive the signal. Even if 
                    several paths are blocked by walls or buildings, others may 
                    have a reasonable transmission path. Using multiple transmitters 
                    effectively reduces the transmission distance, as the closest 
                    transmitter dominates the signal power. </p>
                  <p>An example of how spatial diversity maximizes power efficiency 
                    is lighting of a building. If you were trying to illuminate 
                    a typical large building with a single light bulb, the high 
                    opacity of the walls would result in many deep shadowed regions. 
                    The amount of power that would be required, for all parts 
                    of the building to be reasonably bright, would be extremely 
                    high, as shadowed regions would be lit solely from reflections 
                    and gaps in obstructing walls, such as doorways. However, 
                    by using one light per room, the illumination will be much 
                    more even, with minimal shadowing and a reduced total lighting 
                    power. The same is also true for radio signals; thus by using 
                    multiple transmitters spread over the area of a building, 
                    we can reduce the average path loss.</p>
                  <p>Most communication systems need two-way communications using 
                    a forward and reverse link. Due to the reciprocal nature of 
                    radio propagation, the properties of the reverse link will 
                    be the same as the forward link. Thus, the path loss for the 
                    reverse link can also be minimized by using multiple receive 
                    antennas connected to a single central BS. The receive and 
                    transmit antennas can be combined into one unit, referred 
                    to here as an access point repeater (APR). The use of APRs 
                    can provide a significant improvement with minimal expense.</p>
                  <p>The problem with using APRs is that the mobile receiver will 
                    see signals from all APR transmitters. The propagation delay 
                    from each transmitter will be different and, thus, will arrive 
                    at the receiver with a different delay. This is equivalent 
                    to receiving the signal distorted by strong multipath. This 
                    causes frequency-selective fading, and an increase in the 
                    delay spread of the transmission, which can result in inter-symbol 
                    interference (ISI). This is particularly a problem for modulation 
                    schemes such as frequency shift keying (FSK), as the maximum 
                    symbol rate is limited by ISI caused by delay spread. </p>
                  <p>DSSS systems have a high multipath tolerance due to use of 
                    a RAKE receiver [3]. A RAKE receiver uses correlation to resolve 
                    delayed copies of the signal caused by multipath propagation. 
                    These are then aligned in time and combined. This allows the 
                    signals from each of the transmitters to be resolved and combined. 
                    The maximum delay spread that can be tolerated by an IEEE802.11b 
                    DSSS WLAN system, using a 16-tap RAKE receiver, is 125 ns 
                    at 11 Mb/s and 250 ns at 5.5 Mb/s [4]. This level of multipath 
                    tolerance should allow APRs to be spaced out with a maximum 
                    diameter of about 20-35 m, although problems might arise due 
                    to the increased delay spread. This small antenna spacing 
                    means that there would be little advantage in using multiple 
                    APR with an IEEE802.11b system as sufficient coverage can 
                    easily be obtained over 20-35 m with a single transmitter.</p>
                  <p>OFDM has a higher multipath tolerance than DSSS, and can 
                    transmit using a higher spectral efficiency. Minimizing the 
                    path loss allows the SNR to be increased, provided inter-cellular 
                    interference is low. This improved SNR can be utilized by 
                    adaptively setting the modulation scheme based on the SNR, 
                    allowing the throughput of the system to be increased. </p>
                  <p>The high multipath tolerance of OFDM is due the low symbol 
                    rate used, and the use of a guard period between symbols. 
                    The guard period is a cyclic extension of each OFDM symbol, 
                    giving protection against ISI, provided it is longer than 
                    the delay spread of the radio channel. Typically, the guard 
                    period is made to be a small fraction of the OFDM symbol time 
                    and, thus, by using a large number of narrow bandwidth carriers, 
                    the delay spread tolerance can be varied to suit the radio 
                    conditions. </p>
                  <p>Multipath causes frequency-selective fading, which can result 
                    in carriers of the OFDM signal being lost in nulls in the 
                    spectrum. These nulls are typically handled by including forward 
                    error correction to compensate for the lost data. Adding multiple 
                    transmitters will result in an increased delay spread, resulting 
                    in a decrease in the correlation bandwidth of the channel. 
                    This will not cause any detrimental effects on the OFDM transmission, 
                    provided that enough carriers are used. </p>
                  <p>Indoor propagation normally suffers from a combination of 
                    Rician and Rayleigh fading [5]. Using multiple APRs will increase 
                    the multipath energy, resulting in more areas in the building 
                    suffering from Rayleigh fading. However, this increase in 
                    fading should be more than compensated for by the decreased 
                    path loss due to the multiple APRs. More research is needed 
                    to establish the extent of the additional multipath when using 
                    APRs. </p>
                  <p>The use of multiple transmitters to obtain improved coverage 
                    was first introduced in the digital audio broadcasting (DAB) 
                    system [6]. DAB uses OFDM with a low symbol rate and a long 
                    guard period. With DAB, it is possible for all transmitters 
                    to use the same frequency and transmit copies of the same 
                    signal, referred to as a single-frequency network (SFN). For 
                    VHF band transmissions, DAB uses 1536 carriers with a the 
                    symbol time of 1 ms, and a guard period of 246 ms, allowing 
                    transmitters to be up 96 km apart in a SFN, before the delay 
                    spread is too large. </p>
                  <p>Hiperlan/2 has a guard period of 800 ns, which would provide 
                    an effective delay spread protection of up to 250 ns. This 
                    would allow APRs within each cell, to be placed with a maximum 
                    diameter of 40-60 m, which is sufficient for coverage of most 
                    buildings. Additional research is needed to verify this.</p>
                  <h2>III. Implementation of an APR</h2>
                  <p>All APRs within the same cell transmit and receive the same 
                    signal, thus only one BS is needed per cell. For transmission, 
                    the signal generated by a BS is split N ways, where N is the 
                    number of APRs. Coaxial cable or some other medium, such as 
                    optic fibre, is used to deliver the signal to each APR. The 
                    signal then is amplified at the APR to compensate for any 
                    losses in the coax transmission. For reception, the reverse 
                    process is used. Each APR has a low noise amplifier (LNA) 
                    to compensate for losses in the coax, in order to maintain 
                    a low noise figure. The received signals from all APRs are 
                    combined, then demodulated at the BS. Phase differences between 
                    the APRs have little or no effect as they corrected for, in 
                    the OFDM demodulation process. </p>
                  <p align="center"><img src="fig2.gif" width="270" height="134" alt="APR diagram"></p>
                  <p class="caption">Fig. 2. Possible implementation of an APR.</p>
                  <p>Fig 2. shows a simple implementation of an APR, which can 
                    be used when the loss in the coaxial cable is low (< 20 dB). 
                    The master head amplifier operates at the RF frequency and, 
                    thus, no frequency translation is required. A low frequency 
                    control signal can be used to select whether to transmit or 
                    receive. For a full duplex system, the RF switches can be 
                    replaced with diplexers. </p>
                  <p>In larger systems where the cable losses are too large, the 
                    signal can be transmitted on the cable at an IF frequency. 
                    A common clock reference must be used by all APRs to ensure 
                    frequency synchronization, otherwise frequency errors will 
                    reduce the orthogonality of the OFDM, causing inter-carrier 
                    interference. A suitable out-of-band clock reference must 
                    be transmitted from the base station. This common clock can 
                    then be frequency multiplied using a phase-locked-loop (PLL) 
                    to generate the local oscillator (LO) for the IF-RF mixing. 
                    For such a design, care must be taken to ensure the phase 
                    noise of the clock reference is low and that the clock signal 
                    does not interfere with the received signal.</p>
                  <p>Another method for distributing high frequency RF signals 
                    is to use optic fiber. The RF signals can be converted to 
                    optical signals and transmitted over long distances with optic 
                    fiber. This type of technology is currently being developed 
                    for use in mobile phone applications as a method for producing 
                    pico-sized cells [7]. </p>
                  <h2>IV. Experimental Setup</h2>
                  <p>An experiment was set up to test the effectiveness of using 
                    multiple transmitters (i.e., APR) to minimize shadowing in 
                    an indoor environment. The forward link from the BS to the 
                    mobile stations was tested, by measuring the effective path 
                    loss from fixed transmitters to a mobile receiver. The path 
                    loss from a single transmitter (simulating a single access 
                    point) was compared with the path loss when using two transmitters 
                    (simulating two APRs). </p>

                    lines are plaster board walls, and the thick ones are concrete 
                    walls.</p>
                  <p>The path loss was measured at 235 locations on the second 
                    floor of the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) building 
                    at James Cook University, Townsville, Qld., Australia. The 
                    measurement locations and the building layout are shown in 
                    Fig. 3. The internal walls are shown as dark lines. The selection 
                    of the measurement locations, the position of the transmitters, 
                    and the construction of the building can easily influence 
                    the overall path-loss probability distribution. However, the 
                    results presented will be representative of the improvement 
                    that could be expected in a typical building of similar construction 
                    to the one the measurements were taken in. </p>

                    Point Repeaters. The total transmitter power from Tx2a and 
                    Tx2b were matched to the Tx1 power.</p>
                  <p>The transmitter set up is shown in Fig. 4. Simple monopole 
                    antennas were used and were assumed to have an effective gain 
                    of 0 dBi, including matching losses. The uncertainty in the 
                    gain of the antennas resulted in an absolute error in the 
                    path-loss measurements of approximately 3 dB and a differential 
                    error between the single and dual transmitter measurements 
                    of 1dB. The signal strength at each location was measured 
                    using a spectrum analyzer on a trolley, and converted to path 
                    loss by compensating for transmitter power and receiver gain. 
                    A slightly different frequency was used for the single and 
                    dual transmitters to allow simultaneous measurements of the 
                    path loss. The receiver antenna was placed on a rotating platform 
                    that was turned during the received power measurement. Video 
                    averaging on the spectrum analyzer was used to average the 
                    power over a 0.6 m circular path swept by the antenna. This 
                    was done to remove the effects of frequency selective fading, 
                    and obtain an accurate measure of the path loss. Even though 
                    the path loss was measured using a continuous wave transmission, 
                    the results are still valid for a wide-bandwidth modulation 
                    schemes. </p>
                  <p>Due to limitations of the equipment available, the measurements 
                    were performed at 1 GHz, rather than 5 GHz. This will tend 
                    to reduce the effects of shadowing, as the opacity of most 
                    materials is lower at lower RF frequencies; thus, we would 
                    expect the effectiveness of using APRs to improve at higher 
                    RF frequencies. </p>
                  <h2>V. Discussion of Measured Results</h2>
                  <p>Fig. 5 shows the path loss for the single transmitter. The 
                    path loss increases rapidly with distance from the transmitter. 
                    The path loss in the bottom left corner of Fig. 5 at location 
                    5 x 5 m has a high path loss of over 100 dB, which is equivalent 
                    to 1 km of free-space loss, even though it is less than 20 
                    m from the transmitter. Fig. 6 shows the path loss when two 
                    transmitters were used. In this case the path loss is lower 
                    and much more even.</p>

                  <p class="caption">Fig. 6, Measured path loss for two transmitters 
                    at 990 MHz. This simulates two APRs. Note the total transmitter 
                    power is the same as for the one transmitter measurements. 
                    The X shows the location of the transmitters. </p>
                  <p>Fig. 7 shows the measured and simulated probability distribution 
                    of the path loss. It shows that the measured path loss is 
                    more than 7 dB lower when using two transmitters as compared 
                    with one. This result is to be expected, as the longest distance 
                    to a transmitter was reduced by 1.62 times. The typical path-loss 
                    exponent of an obstructed path within a building is 4 - 6 
                    [8], as compared to a path loss exponent of 2 for free-space 
                    loss. We would therefore, expect the path loss to be reduced 
                    by 8.4 - 12.6 dB for a reduction in distance of 1.6 times. 
                    Since the transmission power is split over two transmitters 
                    this will reduce the received power by 3 dB, thus resulting 
                    in an overall improvement of 5.4 - 9.6 dB. This compares well 
                    with the measured improvement of 7 dB. Even though there are 
                    two transmitters, the received signal power tends to be dominated 
                    by the closest transmitter due to the rapid fall of power 
                    with distance. This is why the improvement in signal power 
                    can be estimated with reasonable accuracy by considering the 
                    reduction in distance to the transmitter.</p>

                  <h2>VI. Reduction in Cellular Interference</h2>
                  <p>At a large distance, multiple APRs appear as a point source 
                    and, thus, the received power is the same as when using a 
                    single access point, where the total transmitted power is 
                    the same. This means that the interference to neighboring 
                    systems is approximately the same regardless of the number 
                    of APRs used for fixed total transmission power. The near-field 
                    path loss can be reduced by 7 dB using two APRs, allowing 
                    the total transmitted power to be reduced by up to 7 dB for 
                    the same SNR. This will reduce the overall interference to 
                    nearby WLAN systems by 7 dB. Further improvements could be 
                    made using a higher number of APRs. Using one APR per room 
                    could potentially decrease the near field path loss by 20-30 
                    dB, allowing a large reduction in external interference with 
                    suitable power control. The reduced interference will allow 
                    a better frequency reuse in a cellular system.</p>
                  <h2>VII. Shadow Modeling</h2>
                  <p>A simplified ray trace path loss model was developed to allow 
                    investigation into the use of multiple APRs. This is similar 
                    to the model used in [9]. The two dimensional (2-D) model 
                    calculates the path loss along radial rays, which are converted 
                    to a fixed rectangular data grid using interpolation. The 
                    rectangular grid allows the signal power from multiple transmitter 
                    sources to the added together. </p>
                  <p align="center"><img src="fig8.gif" width="270" height="249" alt="ray tracer pathloss calculations"></p>
                  <p class="caption">Fig. 8. Attenuation calculations for a ray 
                    passing through two objects. </p>
                  <p>The path loss along each ray is found by calculating its 
                    intercept to each object in the environment. The loss through 
                    each object is calculated based on the reflection coefficient 
                    of the object surface and the distance through the object. 
                    Each surface the ray intercepts results in energy being reflected 
                    causing a jump in the accumulated attenuation. As shown in 
                    Fig. 8(a), surface 1 - 4 result in jumps in the cumulated 
                    object loss shown in Fig. 8(b). In this model, the amount 
                    of reflected energy is constant regardless of the angle of 
                    the ray. This reflected energy is not calculated as another 
                    ray, and is ignored to keep the model simple.</p>
                  <p>In addition to reflected losses, each object absorbs energy 
                    as the ray passes through it. This is calculated as a loss 
                    proportional, in dB, to the distance traveled through the 
                    object medium. The loss along the ray is accumulated as the 
                    ray passes through multiple objects. This loss is then added 
                    to the loss calculated by the standard free-space radio path-loss 
                    equation to obtain the overall attenuation with distance. 
                    The radio path-loss equation is</p>
                  <p align="center"><img src="eq1.gif" width="175" height="62" alt="Pl=-10*log10((lambda/(4*pi*R))^alpha)"></p>
                  <p>where <i>PL</i> is the path loss (in decibels), <i>lambda</i> 
                    is the wavelength of the radio signal (in meters), <i>r</i> 
                    is the distance from the transmitter (in meters), and <i>alpha 
                    (a) </i> is the path loss exponent. For free space propagation, 
                    <i>a</i> = 2. The simulation calculates the path loss due 
                    to objects and, thus, ideally, the path-loss exponent used 
                    in the simulation should be 2. However due to the simplicity 
                    of the model, a path loss exponent of 2.65 was found to best 
                    match the measured results. </p>
                  <h2>VIII. Model Verification, Tuning and Limitations</h2>
                  <p>The radio model was compared to the measured results to verify 
                    the model accuracy and to adjust the model parameters to give 
                    realistic results. The material properties of the walls were 
                    measured directly and are show in Table I. These values compare 
                    well with values measured in [9]. The walls were found to 
                    be non homogeneous, caused by wiring, reinforcing, studs, 
                    and near by objects, making accurate measurements difficult. 
                  </p>
                  <p>In the simulation, the material properties of the walls were 
                    optimized to obtain a good match between the simulated and 
                    measured building path loss shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6. The 
                    resulting simulation parameters were found to closely match 
                    the direct wall loss measurements, as shown in Table I. Fig. 
                    7 shows the resulting match between the measured and simulated 
                    results. This figure shows the percentage area of the building 
                    (Y-axis), which has a path loss worse than a specified path 
                    loss in the X-axis. For example, 20% of the building has a 
                    path loss of greater than 90dB when using a single transmitter, 
                    where as it is only 3% for two transmitters. </p>
                  <p>There is a good match between the simulated and measured 
                    results, despite the simplicity of the model. If the wall 
                    loss were considerably higher, then the path loss would have 
                    been dominated by diffraction and multiple reflections, resulting 
                    in a poor accuracy in the path-loss prediction. </p>
                  <h2>IX. Simulated Results</h2>
                  <p>Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 show the simulated path loss for a single 
                    and double transmitter respectively, for the same building 
                    and transmitter location as measured data shown in Fig. 5 
                    and Fig. 6. The probability distribution of the path loss 
                    is shown in Fig. 8. The main difference between the simulated 
                    and measured results is that the simulated results are smoother, 
                    which is the result of the simple environment model. </p>

                  <p>In addition to simulating one and two transmitters, the path 
                    loss was simulated with four and eight transmitters. The transmitters 
                    were positioned in the simulation to approximately maximize 
                    their effectiveness. Fig. 11 shows the path loss distribution 
                    for all the simulated results. The path loss for the worst 
                    2% of the area of the building was improved by 7 dB when using 
                    two transmitters, 16 dB for four transmitters and 22 dB for 
                    eight transmitters. </p>

                  <h2>X. Conclusion</h2>
                  <p>Using multiple APRs is a low-cost method that can be used 
                    to reduce shadowing and near-field path loss within a building. 
                    This allows a reduction in intercellular interference with 
                    suitable power control. It was shown experimentally to decrease 
                    the near-field path loss by 7 dB @ 1 GHz within an indoor 
                    environment, using two repeaters as compared with a single 
                    transmitter. Simulated results show that the improvement can 
                    be as much as 20 dB for eight transmitters. Using multiple 
                    APRs will result in an increase in the received multipath, 
                    however OFDM systems, including Hiperlan/2 and IEEE 802.11a, 
                    should be able to tolerate this without detrimental effects. 
                    This tolerance should allow a maximum spacing of 40-60 m between 
                    any two APRs in a Hiperlan/2 cell. </p>
